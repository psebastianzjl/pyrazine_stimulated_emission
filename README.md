# pyrazine_stimulated_emission
Code used for QC-NADMD and DW spectra as well as a working example using the models employed for this publication.

This repository contains four folders: the training data used in this work to train the models and predict their accuracy (training data), the interface used to propagate the trajectories (interface_ml_predictions), the codes used for postprocessing the data to obtain the spectra (postprocessing) and one working example for a single trajectory.
